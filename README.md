# Precision-Exteriors-Webpage

This is a webapge I'm creating for a friend's landscaping business.
If this is James, I hope you like what you see :)

I also plan to include this in my Github portfolio for potential employers to view.
So if you're an employer, hello, and I plan on keeping this README as a more detailed log of my thought proccess and experience with this project.

(I also plan to redo the below section for each README as to keep it from getting super, super long)

Day 1 - After about an hour and a half, I'm calling it quits for the night. I believe I've finished the general framework of the HTML for the main page. 
Now all that's left for the night is to write my commits and upload my progress to my Github.
