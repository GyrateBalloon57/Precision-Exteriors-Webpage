# Precision-Exteriors-Webpage

This is a webapge I'm creating for a friend's landscaping business.
If this is James, I hope you like what you see :)

I also plan to include this in my Github portfolio for potential employers to view.
So if you're an employer, hello, and I plan on keeping this README as a more detailed log of my thought proccess and experience with this project.

(I also plan to redo the below section for each README as to keep it from getting super, super long)

Day 2- 

I've gotten most of the layout for the page completed. 

I still haven't bothered with centering a lot of stuff for now, and it still looks kinda terrible without margins, padding, or borders. I've accomplished my goal for the time being, however. 

I'm likely going to shelve this project for a few days in hope that my courses will grant me some more depth and features to include in the page, such as carousels.



Also, my naming conventions for my CSS are kinda messy right now. I plan on giving it a refactor in the future :)
